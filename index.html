        <h2>MegaMind Project – Research Track 10</h2>
        <img src="contain/MegaMindLogo.png" alt="MegaMind logo" style="max-width: 200px; float: right; margin-left: 20px;">
        <p>As part of the NWO-funded MegaMind project, I serve as the lead researcher from TU Delft in <strong>Research Track 10 (RT10)</strong>. 
        This track focuses on the development of data-driven and AI-based methodologies to support real-time coordination between 
        transmission system operators (TSOs) and distribution system operators (DSOs). My research aims to enhance grid stability, 
        resilience, and flexibility by integrating machine learning into operational decision-making. Through close collaboration 
        with academic and industrial partners—including TNO, TenneT, Stedin, and IBM—we explore how intelligent algorithms can 
        enable secure and adaptive control strategies for future-proof energy systems. The work is a step toward building more intelligent, 
        cooperative, and decentralized energy infrastructures in the Netherlands and beyond.</p>
